# Tetris Game

This Tetris game Python code was created using the Pygame library. The code defines the shapes of the different Tetris blocks and their corresponding colors, 
initializes the game screen and grid, and contains functions for drawing the grid, shapes, and text. It also includes functions for generating random Tetris pieces, 
checking if a piece is in a valid space on the grid, and checking if the game is over. The main game loop is not included in this code, 
but this provides the necessary building blocks for the game.

First run the code, a GUI interface will pop up:

Then press any key to start the game

Then you need to use the arrows on the key board to change the angle of the shapes and get the most lines alligned.

Then if the shapes reach the top line of the game you loose:
