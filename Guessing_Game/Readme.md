# Guessing Game

This is a Python program using the Tkinter library to create a GUI-based guessing game. 
The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 and prompts the user to guess the number. 
The user enters their guess in an Entry widget, and the program responds with a message indicating whether the guess was too high, 
too low, or correct using the messagebox module. The user can continue guessing until they correctly guess the number. 
Once the user guesses the number correctly, the program displays a message indicating they have won the game.

First run the code, a GUI interface will pop up:

Then you need to enter a number between 1 -100:

Then depending if too high or low, a message will pop up:

When you guess right, a message will pop up telling you "You guessed right"
