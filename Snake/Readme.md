# Snake Game

This is a Python script for a simple Snake game using the Turtle module. The game is played on a 400x400 white screen with black borders. 
The player controls a green snake using the arrow keys, and the objective is to eat the red food pellets to grow the snake as long as possible without hitting the walls or its own body. The game ends when the snake hits a wall or its own body, and the final score is displayed. The game can be restarted by relaunching the script. The code includes functions for changing the direction of the snake, checking if the snake is inside the game boundaries, moving the snake and updating the game screen, and setting up the turtle window to listen for keyboard input.

First run the code, a GUI interface will pop up:
